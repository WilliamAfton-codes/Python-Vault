# Python-Vault
A basic encrypt-decrypt service to store your files safely, written in Python!

# Usage
In Command Prompt or Terminal, type the following command:
```
pip install cryptography
```

Download `Python-Vault-x.x.zip` from releases

Extract `encrypt.py` and `decrypt.py` and store them away from your precious file, in their own folder

Place the files you want to encrypt into the same folder as `encrypt.py` and `decrypt.py`

Once ready, run `encrypt.py` and SAVE YOUR KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA LOSS!

If you have a file to decrypt, follow the same process by runnning `decrypt.py`, storing your file into the same folder and pasting your key


IF YOU HAVE AN ENCRYPTED FILE AND A DECRYPTED FILE IN THE FOLDER AT THE SAME TIME AND RUN A SCRIPT, YOUR FILES WILL BREAK! KEEP IT ONE AT A TIME

# Features
 • Incredibly powerful encryption, near-impossible to manually decrypt
 
 • Easy-to-use and simple process
 
 • Compact code, low size files

 • Gives more security than bare, un-encrypted files
 
# Notes

IF YOU HAVE AN ENCRYPTED FILE AND A DECRYPTED FILE IN THE FOLDER AT THE SAME TIME AND RUN A SCRIPT, YOUR FILES WILL BREAK! KEEP IT ONE AT A TIME

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA LOSS, ANY FILES CORRUPTED ARE OF YOUR OWN DOING AND I WILL NOT BE HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE. USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION
